# DissOppl

These are the LaTeX source files of my PhD thesis. Back then, I've used Bazaar as a versioning system, eventually switched to Mercurial and now have settled with Git for final long-term archival of my files and their history.

While the thesis was written in German, the souces might still be useful to serve as a template for other theses. It makes use of several LaTeX packages that come with any standard distribution and relies on [XeLaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX) for typesetting (as Unicode support made my life much easier).

The sources are complete (including all images and their sources, which were largely created using [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)). The only file currently lacking is the BibTeX-database, as it was maintained outside the versioned folder. If I find the time, I might add it someday and modify the LaTeX-source accordingly.
