# DissOppl

These are the LaTeX source files of my PhD thesis. Back then, I've used [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/) as a versioning system, eventually switched to [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org) and now have settled with Git for final long-term archival of my files and their history.

While the thesis was written in German, the souces might still be useful to serve as a template for other theses. It makes use of several LaTeX packages that come with any standard distribution and relies on [XeLaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX) for typesetting (as Unicode support made my life much easier).

I have written the thesis on a Mac using [TextMate](https://macromates.com) as the main text editor. Some edits were also made on a Ubuntu-run Netbook (while that was a thing) using [Kile](http://kile.sourceforge.net) as an editor. The sources are complete (including all images and their sources, which were largely created using [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle)). The repository also includes my BibTeX-database, which should contain all references also used in the thesis (and many more). It was created and maintained using [BibDesk](http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net).
